# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds YOLO (You Only Look Once) machine learning object detection capabilities to the Huspy: Blue Rover project. The system will enable real-time object detection and classification using the rover's camera feed and detect a dog filed with light weights placed for the model to run on the CPU as a 1st phase, allowing for autonomous navigation assistance, object tracking, and intelligent behavior based on detected objects. The implementation must be optimized for Raspberry Pi 4+ hardware constraints while maintaining acceptable performance for real-time operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a rover operator, I want the system to detect and identify objects in the camera feed in real-time,and detect my dog so that I can have enhanced situational awareness and enable autonomous behaviors and make the rover tail my dog

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera is active THEN the system SHALL process video frames through YOLO object detection
2. WHEN objects are detected THEN the system SHALL classify them with confidence scores above 50%
3. WHEN processing video frames THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 10 FPS on Raspberry Pi 4
4. WHEN multiple objects are detected THEN the system SHALL track up to 20 objects simultaneously
5. IF no objects are detected THEN the system SHALL continue processing without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a rover operator, I want to see detected objects highlighted in the video stream, so that I can visually confirm what the system is detecting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN objects are detected THEN the system SHALL draw bounding boxes around detected objects
2. WHEN displaying bounding boxes THEN the system SHALL show object class labels and confidence scores
3. WHEN multiple objects are present THEN the system SHALL use different colors for different object classes
4. WHEN the web interface is active THEN detected objects SHALL be visible in the live video stream
5. IF object detection is disabled THEN the video stream SHALL display normally without annotations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a rover operator, I want to configure which types of objects to detect, so that I can focus on relevant objects for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the operator SHALL be able to enable/disable specific object classes
2. WHEN object classes are disabled THEN the system SHALL not report or display those objects
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring restart
4. WHEN using default settings THEN the system SHALL detect common objects (person, car, bicycle, dog, etc.)
5. IF invalid object classes are specified THEN the system SHALL log warnings and use default classes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a rover operator, I want object detection data to be logged and available via API, so that I can analyze detection patterns and integrate with other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN objects are detected THEN the system SHALL log detection events with timestamps
2. WHEN logging detection data THEN the system SHALL include object class, confidence, and bounding box coordinates
3. WHEN the web API is queried THEN the system SHALL return current detection results in JSON format
4. WHEN detection history is requested THEN the system SHALL provide the last 100 detection events
5. IF logging is disabled THEN the system SHALL still provide real-time detection data via API

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a rover operator, I want the system to trigger alerts for specific objects, so that I can be notified of important detections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configured alert objects are detected THEN the system SHALL send notifications
2. WHEN person detection is enabled THEN the system SHALL trigger high-priority alerts
3. WHEN alert thresholds are configured THEN the system SHALL only alert when confidence exceeds threshold
4. WHEN multiple alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL rate-limit notifications to prevent spam
5. IF alert systems are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue detection without blocking

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a rover operator, I want object detection to work efficiently on Raspberry Pi hardware, so that the system remains responsive and doesn't impact other rover functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN object detection is running THEN CPU usage SHALL not exceed 80% on Raspberry Pi 4
2. WHEN processing video frames THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed 1GB
3. WHEN other rover services are active THEN object detection SHALL not interfere with control responsiveness
4. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce detection frame rate
5. IF hardware acceleration is available THEN the system SHALL utilize GPU/NPU capabilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a rover operator, I want to easily enable or disable object detection, so that I can control system resource usage based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the web interface THEN the operator SHALL have a toggle to enable/disable object detection
2. WHEN object detection is disabled THEN the system SHALL free up allocated resources
3. WHEN enabling object detection THEN the system SHALL initialize within 5 seconds
4. WHEN switching modes THEN the camera stream SHALL continue without interruption
5. IF initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback gracefully

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the YOLO integration to follow the existing project architecture, so that it integrates seamlessly with current rover systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing YOLO features THEN the code SHALL follow existing project structure and patterns
2. WHEN adding new services THEN they SHALL integrate with the current systemd service management
3. WHEN extending the web interface THEN new features SHALL match existing UI/UX patterns
4. WHEN adding configuration options THEN they SHALL use the existing configuration system
5. IF new dependencies are required THEN they SHALL be added to requirements.txt with version pinning
