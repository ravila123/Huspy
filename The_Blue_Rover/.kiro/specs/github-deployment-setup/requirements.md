# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the Blue Rover project into a professional, GitHub-ready repository that can be easily deployed on a Raspberry Pi via SSH. The system should provide automated setup, proper project structure, comprehensive documentation, and seamless remote deployment capabilities for a robotics control system featuring PS5 controller integration, manual keyboard control, live camera streaming, and battery monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clone the repository and run a single setup command on my Raspberry Pi, so that I can quickly deploy the Blue Rover system without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clones the repository THEN the system SHALL provide a setup script that installs all dependencies
2. WHEN the setup script runs THEN the system SHALL configure all required services and permissions automatically
3. WHEN setup completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for running the rover controls
4. IF the setup encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and recovery instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a remote operator, I want to control the Blue Rover via SSH from any location, so that I can operate the robot without physical access to the Pi.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SSH is configured THEN the system SHALL allow secure remote access with key-based authentication
2. WHEN connected via SSH THEN the user SHALL be able to run all rover control modes (PS5, keyboard, monitoring)
3. WHEN running remotely THEN the system SHALL provide access to live camera streams via web interface
4. WHEN operating remotely THEN the system SHALL log all activities and provide real-time status feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive documentation and professional project structure, so that other developers can easily understand, contribute to, and deploy the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the repository THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed README with project overview, features, and setup instructions
2. WHEN exploring the codebase THEN the system SHALL have organized directory structure with clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN reading documentation THEN the system SHALL include hardware requirements, software dependencies, and troubleshooting guides
4. WHEN contributing THEN the system SHALL provide development guidelines and code standards

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated service management and monitoring, so that the Blue Rover system runs reliably and can recover from failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL automatically start required services using systemd
2. WHEN services fail THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic restart and log failure details
3. WHEN monitoring battery levels THEN the system SHALL provide alerts for low battery conditions
4. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle resource constraints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper dependency management and environment isolation, so that the Blue Rover installation doesn't conflict with other Python projects on my Pi.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use a virtual environment to isolate packages
2. WHEN requirements change THEN the system SHALL provide easy update mechanisms
3. WHEN multiple Python projects exist THEN the system SHALL not interfere with other installations
4. IF dependency conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing and validation, so that I can ensure the system works correctly after deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setup completes THEN the system SHALL provide validation tests for hardware connectivity
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL verify camera, motors, and controller functionality
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific diagnostic information
4. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL run regression tests automatically
